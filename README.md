# About me:


- I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong passion for web application development. 

- I am interested in the integration of language models in web applications as well as task automation.

- I'm currently learning Spring Boot.

- My development philosophy is based on constructive criticism of the code itself: I firmly believe that there are no impossible problems, only paths that remain to be discovered to reach the solution. I seek to apply good programming practices, with the goal of writing clear, maintainable and quality code.
